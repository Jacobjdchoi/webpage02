                description: "Diakont EMAs are equipped with inverted roller screws, which require much less space than ball screw or pneumatic solutions with equivalent specifications (force, speed, etc.). Owing to this optimized design, Diakont actuators require smaller housings and fewer parts between the motor and the roller screw, thereby reducing the overall weight and size of the EMA. The Diakont DA Series actuator line of reduced weight starts at 5 kg."

Diakont EMAs are compatible with various third party servo drives and amplifiers. As a result, Diakont actuators allow for easy integration into existing motion control systems. Diakont DA Series actuators are also equipped with specialized patented lubrication ports that facilitate scheduled maintenance without requiring disassembly, recalibration, or removal from machinery. Performing maintenance with the actuator on the machine reduces downtime and improves output."
